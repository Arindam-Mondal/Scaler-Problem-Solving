/**
 *
 * Divisor game
 *
 * Problem Description
 * Scooby has 3 three integers A, B, and C.
 *
 * Scooby calls a positive integer special if it is divisible by B and it is divisible by C. You need to tell the number of special integers less than or equal to A.
 *
 *
 *
 * Problem Constraints
 * 1 <= A, B, C <= 109
 *
 *
 *
 * Input Format
 * First argument is a positive integer A
 * Second argument is a positive integer B
 * Third argument is a positive integer C
 *
 *
 *
 * Output Format
 * One integer corresponding to the number of special integers less than or equal to A.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example Input
 * Input 1:
 *
 *  A = 12
 *  B = 3
 *  C = 2
 * Input 2:
 *
 *  A = 6
 *  B = 1
 *  C = 4
 *
 *
 * Example Output
 * Output 1:
 *
 *  2
 * Output 2:
 *
 *  1
 *
 *
 * Example Explanation
 * Explanation 1:
 *
 *  The two integers divisible by 2 and 3 and less than or equal to 12 are 6,12.
 * Explanation 2:
 *
 *  Only 4 is a positive integer less than equal to 6 which is divisible by 1 and 4.
